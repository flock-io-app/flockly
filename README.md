Node Explorer to support decentralized AI training at Flock.io

## About

An explorer for training nodes and validators within the FLock ecosystem. This explorer offers detailed insights, allowing users to click on a training node and view performance metrics, past contributions. To assist delegators in conducting research before committing resources.

## Setup

You need these stack ready on your env

- Python -> we used 3.12.2
- Node -> we used v20

### Back-End

Follow the README file in [backend folder]("https://github.com/flock-io-app/flockly/tree/master/backend")

### Front-End

Just like common NextJS project

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Done! Enjoy our explorer :)
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

We just built in 2 days, plenty rooms to optimize things. Let us know if you have feedback!
